This is the following fields in order:
validator identity pubkey
number of successful vote tx
number of failed vote tx
number of slots from the range of interest that were voted on
% of voted on slots that were voted on before consensus
average vote latency (by voted-on slot)
average vote latency (by vote tx)

I have sorted the list by number of successful vote tx since that's the value you originally asked about (I think).
One bit of good news is that the total vote tx I have for Certus and Fire are the same as what you have, so the data checks out at least at that level.
